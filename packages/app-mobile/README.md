# Backpack ðŸŽ’ðŸ“±

Android and iOS apps powered via react-native.

## Requirements

- A phone or Simulator (Download XCode)
- At least two terminal windows

## Quick Start

- Follow [Expo's Installation Instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

  - Make sure this works: `npx expo -h`
  - Make sure you have an account: `npx expo whoami`

- Install [Eas](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/#install-the-latest-eas-cli)

```sh
npm install -g eas-cli
```

- In one terminal window, from the _root backpack folder_ run:

```sh
yarn build:mobile && yarn start:mobile
```

- Make sure you see a green screen when navigating to [http://localhost:9333](http://localhost:9333).

This runs our service worker which the mobile app talks to inside src/App.tsx

- In a separate terminal window, from `packages/app-mobile`, run:

```sh
yarn ios -c
```

An iPhone simulator should open up and you should be well on your way!

If you want to run Android, run:

```sh
yarn android -c
```

Android emulators don't support running localhost:9333 in your local environment.
It tries to connect to the local phone's server which doesn't exist.

### TroubleShooting

#### I'm stuck on a black screen with a white backpack logo

Potential problems:

- 1. The service worker is not running.
- 2. You're running android and pointing to localhost:9333 which doesn't work

Solutions:

- 1. Verify [http://localhost:9333](http://localhost:9333) has a green background.
     If it's not, run `yarn start:mobile` or in a separate terminal window, `cd packages/background && yarn start`.

- 2. Until we have a better way, go into src/App.tsx and replace `localWebViewUrl` with `remoteWebViewUrl`
     located [here](https://github.com/coral-xyz/backpack/blob/master/packages/app-mobile/src/App.tsx#L132)
     That line should look like this: `const webviewUrl = remoteWebViewUrl`

## notes

### service worker stuff

- [limitsNavigationsToAppBoundDomains](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/issues/1956) is required. Otherwise, `onMessage` will not fire, both locally and remotely.
- [NSAllowsArbitraryLoads](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsapptransportsecurity/nsallowsarbitraryloads) setting this true disables App Transport Security which would allow unsecured HTTP connections. By enabling this you must supply a justification during App Store Review
- [NSExceptionDomains](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW35) if you allow arbitrary loads, NSExceptionDomains will continue to support ATS
- [WKAppBoundDomains](https://webkit.org/blog/10882/app-bound-domains/) once this is set
- [WKAppBoundDomains order matters](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227531) it will only load up to 3 service workers and ignore the rest. If there are 5 sites with service workers listed, only 3 of them will fire the service worker. The other 2 will be ignored
