### Send push notifications to users

You can send push notifications to users that have installed your xnft and have given the `xnft` access to send push notifications.
Before you begin, make sure you've asked the users to give `push notificaiton `permissions to your xnft.
They can do that by going into `Profile > xNfts > Your xnft > Push notifications`
