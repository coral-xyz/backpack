## Media stream examples

The example shows how you can get access to and show media streams captured from
the users native camera and mic.

## How to test

Ensure you've gone to `<your_chrome_extension_url>/assets/index.html` before testing the example and you have
given camera and mic permissions to the extension for the example to work.

You can get your `chrome_extension_url` by logging `window.location` in the console.

We'll be making this flow more intuitive in the future.
